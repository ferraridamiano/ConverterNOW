⚠️ Are asking about adding a new currency? ⚠️
Converter NOW is a free and open source project. The amount of donations it
receives are too low to pay an exchange rate api service. At the moment we are
using the free exchange rate api of the european central bank, it provides a lot
of conversions (but not all). You can check the supported currencies here:
https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/euro_reference_exchange_rates/html/index.en.html
Don't open a new issue if the currency you would like to see is not supported by
this service.

**Description**
Add here a brief explanation to which units should be added and possibly why
(e.g. they are often used in a specific job). We know that there are a ton of
unit of measurement that are not yet added to this app. We want to have just the
most used one.
