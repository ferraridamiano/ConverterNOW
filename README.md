## Why I made Converter NOW

A few years ago I noticed that most of the unit converters on the digital stores were ugly, not immediately usable, with tons of useless tools. I thought it would be a  good idea to develop a unit converter app that solve all this problems.

That year (2018) I first heard of Flutter. It still was in beta, but I decided to build it with this modern framework anyway, just to learn more. My friend Giovanni made the app logo for me and I launched it on the Play Store.

The project is not well structured. I made it to learn more about programming. **It is not perfect but I hope that with your help we can improve it!**
