### Web
You can reach the PWA [here](https://converter-now.web.app).

### Web app on Docker
You can run a Docker container of Converter NOW in your environment by running:

```shell
docker run -d -p 80:80 ghcr.io/ferraridamiano/ConverterNOW:latest
```

Then, you can access it via browser on `localhost:80`

## Build from source code
First you need to
[install flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and all the
tooling for your target platform (e.g. Android Studio for Android, etc.). Then you have to install two tools:

- `dart pub global activate melos` (useful to easily manage the repository)
- `dart pub global activate vector_graphics_compiler` (useful to compile the `svg` icons)

Then, run `melos bootstrap` in the root of the project in order to get all the dependencies, generate the
translation files and optimize the `svg` icons. Then follow the instructions for the platform you want to target.

### Android
On Android you should first disable the signing option in
[`android/app/build.gradle`](https://github.com/ferraridamiano/ConverterNOW/blob/master/android/app/build.gradle#L57)
Then you can type `flutter build apk --split-per-abi` to compile the code. You
can find the output in `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk` folder.

### Linux
Type `flutter build linux` to build the Linux app. You can find the output in
`build/linux/x64/release/bundle`.

### Windows
Type `flutter build windows` to build the Windows app. You can find the output
in `build/windows/runner/Release`.

### Web
Type `flutter build web` to build the Web app. You can find the output in
`build/web`.

Note: if you deploy it not on the base path, add `--base-href=/path/` to the command above, change `/path/` with your path.

### Web app on Docker
You can build the Docker image of Converter NOW in your environment with the
following command:
```shell
docker build -t converternow .
```

Then, run the docker container:
```shell
docker run -d -p 80:80 converternow
```

You can access it via browser at `localhost:80`

### iOS and MacOS
The app is not tested against iOS and MacOS, but you should be able to compile
it even for these platforms. You first need to generate the platform specific
code and then compile them.
