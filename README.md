## Why Converter NOW

A few years ago I noticed that most of the unit converters on the digital stores were ugly, not immediately usable, with ads and tracking software. I thought it would be a  good idea to develop Converter NOW in order to solve all these problems!

🚀 It is made to be **easy**, **fast** and **usable**: just start typing and immediately you have the real-time conversion with all the other units of measurement!

🖌️ It is **customizable**: the units can be reorganized according to your priorities and your use case

🔢 It integrates a **calculator** that let you do the calculations in every page

💰 Currency exchange rates **updated daily**

🎨 **Dynamic theming** based on your device settings

⚫⚪ **Choose your favourite theme**: dark or white theme

📱🖥️ **Multiplatform**: available for Android, Web, Linux and Windows

💯 It is **free**, **no ads**, **no data collection**, **no permissions** (just Internet to update currency conversions). And first of all it is **open source**!

## Installation

You can find the compiled app in [GitHub releases](https://github.com/ferraridamiano/ConverterNOW/releases) or in all of the following app stores:

### Web
You can reach the PWA [here](https://converter-now.web.app).

## Build from source code
First you need to
[install flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and all the
tooling for your target platform (e.g. Android Studio for Android, etc.). Then you have to install two tools:

- `dart pub global activate melos` (useful to easily manage the repository)
- `dart pub global activate vector_graphics_compiler` (useful to compile the `svg` icons)

Then, run `melos bootstrap` in the root of the project in order to get all the dependencies, generate the
translation files and optimize the `svg` icons. Then follow the instructions for the platform you want to target.

### Android
On Android you should first disable the signing option in
[`android/app/build.gradle`](https://github.com/ferraridamiano/ConverterNOW/blob/master/android/app/build.gradle#L70)
(just comment that line). Then you can type `flutter build apk --split-per-abi`
to compile the code. You can find the output in `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk`
folder.

### Linux
Type `flutter build linux` to build the Linux app. You can find the output in
`build/linux/x64/release/bundle`.

### Windows
Type `flutter build windows` to build the Windows app. You can find the output
in `build/windows/runner/Release`.

### Web
Type `flutter build web` to build the Web app. You can find the output in
`build/web`.

Note: if you deploy it not on the base path, add `--base-href=/path/` to the command above, change `/path/` with your path.

### iOS and MacOS
The app is not tested against iOS and MacOS, but you should be able to compile
it even for these platforms. You first need to generate the platform specific
code and then compile them.
